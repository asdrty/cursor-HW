        A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction since the 1880s, and of <br>
        aerospace engineering and scientific proposals <strong>the late 1940s</strong>. Plans include landing <br>
        on Mars for exploration at a minimum, with some considering exploring its moons Phobos <br>
        and Deimos. Longterm proposals have included sending settlers and starting terraforming of <br>
        the planet.

    <h2>Exploration of Mars</h2>

    <p>The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades.<br> 
        Conceptual work for missions that would involve human explorers has been ongoing since <br>
        <strong>the 1950s</strong>, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place anywhere between <br>
        10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.The list of <b>Mars</b> mission plans shows <br>
        the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space <br>
        agencies in this field of space exploration. Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in <br>
        which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a <br>
        few weeks or year, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization or <br>
        other continuous humanization).[citation needed] Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic <br>
        technologies, have also been proposed.[<br>
        <em>In the 2010s</em>, numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for <br>
        human missions to Mars.[citation needed] In fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration <br>
        and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films.
